Part 1: Cloud & AWS Understanding

1. What cloud computing
Ans: Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, 
    storage, databases, and software over the internet instead of using your
    own physical hardware. Instead of buying and maintaining servers, 
    businesses rent resources from cloud providers like Amazon Web Services 
    and use them whenever needed

    Advantages of Cloud Computing:
    * Cost Effective – No need to buy expensive hardware pay only for what you use
    * Scalable – Easily increase or decrease resources based on demand
    * High Availability – Services run with minimal downtime
    * Flexible Access – Access from anywhere with internet
    * Automatic Updates – Cloud provider manages maintenance and upgrades
    * Security – Built-in security features and data protection
    * Backup & Recovery – Easy data backup and disaster recovery

2. Differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
Ans: 
    IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
    IaaS provides virtual servers, storage, and networking over the 
    internet. The cloud provider manages hardware, while users manage the 
    operating system, applications, and data. It offers high control and 
    flexibility, similar to owning a data center without purchasing 
    physical infrastructure

    PaaS (Platform as a Service):
    PaaS provides a ready platform for developing and deploying 
    applications. The provider manages infrastructure and runtime, while 
    users focus only on writing and managing code. It simplifies 
    development, reduces server management, and speeds up 
    application deployment

    SaaS (Software as a Service):
    SaaS delivers fully functional software over the internet. Users access
    applications through a browser without installing or maintaining them. 
    The provider manages everything including infrastructure, updates, and 
    security. It is easy to use and ideal for everyday business applications

3. Why AWS is used and common real-world use cases
Ans: 
    Why AWS is Used:
    Amazon Web Services is used because it is scalable, reliable, secure, 
    and cost-effective. It follows a pay-as-you-go model, meaning businesses
    only pay for what they use. AWS also provides a wide range of services 
    for computing, storage, databases, networking, and analytics, making it 
    suitable for startups as well as large enterprises.

    Common Real-World Use Cases of AWS:
    * Website & Application Hosting 
    * Data Storage & Backup 
    * Big Data & Analytics 
    * Disaster Recovery 
    * Enterprise Applications 
    * DevOps & CI/CD 
    * AI & Machine Learning
    * Content Delivery 

4. Purpose of EC2 and S3 in a cloud architecture
Ans: 
    Purpose of EC2 in Cloud Architecture:
    EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is used to provide virtual servers in the 
    cloud where applications, websites, APIs, or backend services run. It 
    acts like a remote computer where you can install software, configure 
    the operating system, and execute programs. EC2 handles the computing 
    part of the architecture

    Purpose of S3 in Cloud Architecture:
    S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used to store and retrieve data such as 
    files, images, videos, backups, and large datasets. It provides secure, 
    scalable, and durable storage. In a cloud architecture, S3 handles the 
    storage layer while EC2 handles processing or computation
